              "Like many Malaysians adapting to new ways of working and learning, I spent countless hours hunched over my laptop. 
              The constant neck and shoulder strain was frustrating, and I couldn't find a stand that was stable, portable, and looked good on my desk. 
              So, I decided to create my own.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text">
              The name 'Sangga' was chosen deliberately. It's an old Malay term for 'Penahan,' which means a stand or a holder. 
              It's a nod to our heritage and a reflection of the product's purpose: to provide simple, strong, and elegant support.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text">
              I designed Sangga to solve my own problem, but I hope it brings you the same comfort and focus it has brought me."
